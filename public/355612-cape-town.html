If Cape Town was in the dating game that&#39;s how her profile would read. And - for once - it&#39;s all true. The Mother City of South Africa occupies one of the world&#39;s most stunning locations, with an iconic mountain slap-bang in her centre.As beautiful as the surrounding beaches and vineyards can be, it&#39;s the rugged wilderness of Table Mountain, coated in a unique flora, that grabs everyone&#39;s attention.Long before the Dutch took a fancy to the Cape Peninsula in the 17th century, the land was home to the Khoisan people who valued the spiritual power of the mountains and their life-providing water. While the European immigrants, and the slaves they brought here, have all shaped the physical environment of South Africa&#39;s third-largest city, Table Mountain - now protected within a national park that covers some 75% of the peninsula - remains at Cape Town&#39;s heart. This ever present backdrop is the city&#39;s adventure playground, as well as a source of legend and continuing spiritual nourishment. Under the Khoisan name of Hoerikwaggo - meaning &#39;Mountain in the Sea&#39; - the national park is promoting a new series of trails that will allow visitors, for the first time, to sleep on the mountain top while hiking a world-class trail from Cape Point to the City Bowl.Complementing the mountain&#39;s natural beauty is Cape Town&#39;s eye-catching way with design and colour in everything from the brightly painted façades of the Bo-Kaap and the Victorian bathing chalets of Muizenberg, to the contemporary Afro-chic décor of the many excellent guesthouses, restaurants and bars. The city is crammed with galleries displaying amazing artworks and shops selling wonderfully inventive craftwork. It&#39;s also getting a reputation as the fashion nexus of South Africa. This creativity seems to spring naturally from the city&#39;s multiethnic population, proof of South Africa&#39;s status as the rainbow nation and a visual record of the country&#39;s tumultuous recorded history of over 350 years.For all the city centre&#39;s visual harmony and cosmopolitan atmosphere, you don&#39;t need to be in Cape Town for long to realise that the scars of modern South Africa&#39;s violent birth and apartheid adolescence still run deep. The wealth of Camps Bay and Constantia sits side by side with the ingrained poverty of townships, such as Khayelitsha, and the deprived coloured suburbs, home to the vast majority of the city&#39;s citizens. Friendly as Capetonians can be to visitors, among themselves suspicions and misinterpretations endure, and if you take one of the deservedly popular trips into the townships you&#39;ll be a step ahead of the vast majority of locals.Seeing life in the townships may shock and upset, but you&#39;ll also discover it&#39;s not a one-note story of grim survival. There are huge differences in lifestyle and many great examples of civic pride and optimism to balance against the shocking crime and HIV/AIDS statistics. And there&#39;s ubuntu, true African hospitality and care for fellow human beings. Look across the city and you&#39;ll also see people of all skin colours working together to make Cape Town a better place for everyone. Discovering the Mother City&#39;s true diversity and spirit is all part of getting the most out of a visit here.Reality check aside, Cape Town is an old pro at showing visitors a good time. There may not be game parks on Kruger&#39;s scale, but there are plenty of great wildlife-spotting opportunities, from the penguins at Boulders to the antelopes, buffaloes and black rhino at Solole Game Reserve. The restaurants and bars compare favourably with those of other cosmopolitan cities. There&#39;s a lively cultural scene, particularly when it comes to music, which pervades every corner of the city, and if outdoor activities and adrenaline buzzes are your thing, you&#39;ve come to the right place. As local troubadour David Krammer&#39;s sing-along anthem for the Cricket World Cup has it, &#39;Welcome to Cape Town/Enjoy the party/Come in and have some fun/Cape Town&#39;s number one&#39;.The capital of Western Cape province and the parliamentary capital of the republic, Cape Town works in a way that so few cities on the African continent do. Historic buildings have been saved, businesses are booming, inner-city crime is coming under control and you&#39;ll seldom be stuck for a parking space. Factor back in those stunning mountains, magnificent surf beaches and outstanding vineyards and you&#39;ll soon discover - like many before you - that it&#39;s easy to lose track of time while exploring all the wonders of this unique Southern African city. Now don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time you made a date with Cape Town?</p><p></p><p>          Make it happen</p><p></p><p>          Ready to go?

Van der Stel created Groot Constantia, the superb estate on the flanks of Table Mountain, and passed on his wine-making skills to the burghers who settled around Stellenbosch.Between 1688 and 1690, some 200 Huguenots arrived in the country. They were granted land in the region, particularly around Franschhoek (which translates as &#39;French Corner&#39;), and, although only a few had wine-making experience, they gave the infant industry fresh impetus.For a long time, Cape wines other than those produced at Groot Constantia were not in great demand and most grapes ended up in brandy. The industry received a boost in the early 19th century as war between Britain and France meant more South African wine was imported to the UK.Apartheid-era sanctions and the power of the Kooperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereeniging (KWV; the cooperative formed in 1918 to control minimum prices, production areas and quota limits) didn&#39;t exactly encourage innovation and instead hampered the industry. Since 1992 the KWV, now a private company, has lost much of its former influence.Many new and progressive wine makers are leading South Africa&#39;s reemergence onto the world market. New wine-producing areas are being established away from the hotter inland areas, in particular in the cooler coastal areas east of Cape Town around Mossel Bay, Walker Bay and Elgin, and to the north around Durbanville and Darling.</p></div><div class="weather"><h4>Weather</h4><p>If you&#39;ve spent time in the Mediterranean then you&#39;ve experienced Cape Town&#39;s climate. The summers are generally warm and dry, while winters tend to be wet and cool, the rains brought on by fierce northwesterly gales. Neither season experiences extremes of temperature, thanks to prevailing winds.Be prepared though for &#39;four seasons in one day&#39;. The peninsula&#39;s shape creates microclimates, so you can be basking in the sun on one side of the mountain and sheltering from chilly rain and winds on the other. It&#39;s no accident that Newlands is so lush in comparison to Cape Point - the former receives four times as much rain annually as the latter.</p><p>Climate change is a serious threat to the ecosystems that humans rely upon, and air travel is the fastest-growing contributor to the problem. Lonely Planet regards travel, overall, as a global benefit, but believes we all have a responsibility to limit our personal impact on global warming.Flying &amp;amp; Climate ChangePretty much every form of motorised travel generates carbon dioxide (C02; the main cause of human-induced climate change), but planes are far and away the worst offenders, not just because of the sheer distances they allow us to travel, but because they release greenhouse gases high into the atmosphere. The statistics are frightening: two people taking a return flight between Europe and the US will contribute as much to climate change as an average household&#39;s gas and electricity consumption over a whole year. Carbon Offset SchemesClimatecare.org and other websites use &#39;carbon calculators&#39;, which allow travellers to offset the level of greenhouse gases they are responsible for with financial contributions to sustainable-travel schemes that reduce global warming - including projects in India, Honduras, Kazakhstan and Uganda. Lonely Planet, together with Rough Guides and other concerned partners in the travel industry, support the carbon offset scheme run by Climatecare.org. Lonely Planet offsets all of its staff and author travel.For more information check out our website: www.lonelyplanet.com.</p></div><div class="transport"><h4>Transport</h4><p>Flights, tours and rail tickets can all be booked online at www.lonelyplanet.com/travelservices.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body><div id="dragHelper" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; display: none; cursor: move; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;"></div><div style="position: absolute; height: 1px; width: 1px; top: -1000px; left: -1000px;"><span class="ygtvtm">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvtmh">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvtp">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvtph">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvln">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlm">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlmh">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlp">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlph">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvloading">&nbsp;</span></div></html>
