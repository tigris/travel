You can almost feel South Africa&#39;s undercurrents of tension fade away when you cross the border into friendly, easy-going ittle Swaziland, making it a relaxing stopover on the trip between Mozambique and South Africa. And it&#39;s surprising how much there is to do here - the royal ceremonies, excellent wildlife reserves and superb scenery should be more than enough reason to come. Try Hlane Royal National Park for an eyeful of white rhinos, lions and antelopes - camping options are available for overnight stays. You may not want to stay overnight in the somewhat dull Mbanane, but you may well pass through on your way to the Ezulwini &amp; Malkerns Valleys, the former renown for its picturesque scenery and the latter for its handicrafts.</p></div><div class="history"><h4>History</h4><p>In eastern Swaziland archaeologists have discovered human remains dating back 110, 000 years, but the ancestors of the modern Swazi people arrived relatively recently.During the great Bantu migrations into southern Africa, one group, the Nguni, moved down the east coast. A clan settled near what is now Maputo in Mozambique, and a dynasty was founded by the Dlamini family. In the mid-18th century increasing pressure from other Nguni clans forced King Ngwane III to lead his people south to lands by the Pongola River, in what is now southern Swaziland. Today, Swazis consider Ngwane III to have been the first king of Swaziland.The next king, Sobhuza I, withdrew under pressure from the Zulus to the Ezulwini Valley, which today remains the centre of Swazi royalty and ritual. When King Sobhuza I died in 1839, Swaziland was twice its present size. Trouble with the Zulu continued, although the next king, Mswazi (or Mswati), managed to unify the whole kingdom. By the time he died in 1868, the Swazi nation was secure. Mswazi’s subjects called themselves people of Mswazi, or Swazis, and the name stuck.</p></div><div class="weather"><h4>Weather</h4><p>Summer sees torrential thunderstorms, especially in the western mountains, and temperatures on the lowveld are very hot, often over 40°C; in the high country the temperatures are lower and in winter it can get cool. Winter nights on the lowveld are sometimes very cold.Try to avoid visiting rain-soaked Swaziland during the rainy season (December to April). The best time to visit is in May–June or October, but bring something warm.</p></div><div class="transport"><h4>Transport</h4><p>No information available.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body><div id="dragHelper" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; display: none; cursor: move; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;"></div><div style="position: absolute; height: 1px; width: 1px; top: -1000px; left: -1000px;"><span class="ygtvtm">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvtmh">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvtp">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvtph">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvln">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlm">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlmh">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlp">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvlph">&nbsp;</span><span class="ygtvloading">&nbsp;</span></div></html>
